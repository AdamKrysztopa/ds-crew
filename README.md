# Data-science skill suite for Claude Code

> **Thirteen installable Claude Code skills** for end-to-end data science, built on the DS-STAR agent
> (Nam et al., 2025) and follow-on research — answering analytical questions over data files by
> writing and executing Python through an iterative loop that **never trusts code just because it
> ran**, plus clarification, ensembling, profiling, and exploration skills around it.

## Why DS-STAR?

Most AI data-science workflows stop when the code executes. DS-STAR doesn't.
It grows a plan one verified step at a time and uses an LLM-as-judge to confirm
that the **actual execution output** answers the actual question — catching silent failures
like wrong filters, missing joins, and format mismatches before they reach you.

## Installation

### 1. Add the marketplace (one-time per machine)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add AdamKrysztopa/ds-crew
```

### 2. Install the plugin — choose your scope

```bash
# All your projects
claude plugin install ds-crew@ds-crew --scope user

# This project only (saved to .claude/settings.json)
claude plugin install ds-crew@ds-crew --scope project

# Local override, not committed
claude plugin install ds-crew@ds-crew --scope local
```

### 3. Use

Invoke explicitly in any Claude Code session:

```
/ds-star          # baseline iterative solver (paper-faithful)
/ds-star-plus     # reliability- & cost-hardened solver (rubric verifier, routing)
/ds-clarify       # human-in-the-loop: pin down intent → analysis-spec.md
/ds-spike         # ensemble: N data scientists in parallel → consensus + minority report
/data-profile     # standalone data-quality / profiling report
/eda-narrative    # exploration → stakeholder-ready narrative
/ds-conduct       # data-aware orchestrator: peeks at data, grills, assembles + executes crew workflow
/ds-model         # AutoML solution-tree: AIDE-style draft→train→eval→improve loop
/ds-verify        # standalone rubric verifier: grades any answer against the 6 DS failure modes
/ds-reconcile     # blackboard reconciliation: clusters answers into consensus + minority report
/ds-vote          # self-consistency N-vote: majority answer + stability score
/ds-search        # standalone MCTS search: tree-search a single hard task
/ds-memory        # persistent recipe store: remember and reuse what worked across sessions
```

Or just ask an analytical question over a data file — Claude will trigger the right skill
automatically.

### Updating / uninstalling

```bash
claude plugin update ds-crew@ds-crew
claude plugin uninstall ds-crew@ds-crew
```

## The thirteen skills

| skill | what it does | reach for it when |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **`ds-star`** | Baseline iterative solver — analyze files → grow a verified plan one step at a time | reproducing the paper; a simple, single-model baseline |
| **`ds-star-plus`** | Hardened solver: per-role Haiku/Sonnet/Opus routing, **rubric-graded verifier**, oscillation handling, digest caching, two-stage retrieval, optional MCTS search mode | production, multi-file, cost-sensitive, high-reliability work |
| **`ds-clarify`** | Human-in-the-loop pre-flight — interrogate intent, write `analysis-spec.md` | the question is fuzzy, high-stakes, or contested — run it **before** a solver |
| **`ds-spike`** | Ensemble — N diverse data scientists in parallel, reconciled into consensus + minority report | a number that must be right; two runs disagreed (costs N× — spend for confidence) |
| **`data-profile`** | Standalone data-quality / profiling report (per-column + cross-file join checks) | onboarding a dataset; "is this data clean / what's in it?" |
| **`eda-narrative`** | Exploration → a stakeholder-ready narrative, each finding backed by a number/chart | "what's interesting here?" with no single precise question |
| **`ds-conduct`** | Data-aware orchestrator — peeks at data, grills, assembles + executes a crew workflow | Starting fresh with data; fuzzy request; don't know which skills to use |
| **`ds-model`** | AutoML solution-tree — AIDE-style draft→train→eval→improve loop with leakage/CV discipline | Predict/forecast; Kaggle; improve model accuracy |
| **`ds-verify`** | Standalone rubric verifier — grades any answer against the 6 DS failure modes | Check/audit any result from any source |
| **`ds-reconcile`** | Blackboard reconciliation — clusters existing answers into consensus + minority report | Already have multiple answers; want them reconciled |
| **`ds-vote`** | Self-consistency N-vote — same solver N times, majority answer + stability | Quick stability check; moderate-stakes question |
| **`ds-search`** | Standalone MCTS search — tree-search a single hard task | One task keeps failing greedy; want alternative solution paths |
| **`ds-memory`** | Persistent recipe store — remember and reuse what worked across sessions | Inspect/prune past analyses; seed new runs from history |

> **→ [Which skill should I use? See docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md)**

**Typical flow for something important:** `ds-conduct` (orchestrates the whole crew) → `data-profile` → `ds-clarify` → `ds-spike` (ensemble) → reconciled answer. See [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) for all routing options.

### `ds-star` vs `ds-star-plus` at a glance

| | `ds-star` | `ds-star-plus` |
|---|---|---|
| **Model** | Single model throughout | Haiku / Sonnet / Opus per role |
| **Verifier output** | Yes / No | graded `{score 1–4, rubric, checks, reason, missing}` |
| **Backtracking** | Truncate + regenerate | + anti-repeat list, oscillation handling |
| **Token cost** | Full descriptions every round | Schema digests by default |
| **Best for** | Baseline / reproducing the paper | Production, multi-file, cost-sensitive work |

## How the loop works

```
ANALYZE every file (real schema, not guesses)
        │
INITIAL simple step (load + peek)
        │
        ▼
   ┌─── IMPLEMENT (Python script)
   │         │
   │      EXECUTE
   │         │
   │      VERIFY ──── sufficient? ──► FINALIZE ──► answer
   │         │ no
   │      ROUTE: add next step  OR  backtrack to wrong step
   └─────────┘
   (max 20 rounds)
```

The verifier is the load-bearing piece: a false "sufficient" ends the run with a wrong
answer that nothing downstream catches, so `ds-star-plus` pins it to Opus and optionally
runs it 3× with majority vote on borderline calls.

## Reference

Nam, Yoon, Chen & Pfister (2025). *DS-STAR: Data Science Agent via Iterative Planning and
Verification.* arXiv:2509.21825. Google Cloud / KAIST.

The v2 additions (model routing, structured verifier, oscillation handling, digest caching,
two-stage retrieval) are design extensions: there is no new independent benchmark, but each is
justified against a specific finding in the paper — the 3.5× input-token cost (Table 6), the
analyzer/router ablations (Table 4, e.g. hard accuracy 45.24 → 26.98 without descriptions), the
~8-point retrieval-vs-oracle gap (Table 2), and the round distribution (§4.3). The full evidence
chain is in `skills/ds-star-plus/references/evidence.md`; `skills/ds-star-plus/evals/evals.json`
provides checkable test cases.

## Status

All tracks A–M are implemented. Tracks A–D delivered the rubric-graded verifier (DeepVerifier-style),
the human-in-the-loop `ds-clarify`, the capstone `ds-spike` ensemble (blackboard reconciliation),
`data-profile`, `eda-narrative`, and `ds-star-plus`'s optional MCTS search mode + upgraded retrieval.
Tracks E–M (v1.2) add persistent memory (`ds-memory`), stateful kernel execution, DAG planning,
AutoML solution-tree (`ds-model`), debate mode in `ds-spike`, sandbox + provenance, the data-aware
orchestrator (`ds-conduct`), five standalone primitive skills, and the `docs/USAGE.md` routing guide.
Each change is tied to a paper in the bibliography at [`papers/README.md`](papers/README.md); the
tracks, statuses, and dependency order live in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). The Python helpers ship
with unit tests (`python3 -m unittest` in each `scripts/` dir).
